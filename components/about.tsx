            Listen, here's the deal: The financial industry has been lying to you for years. They tell you that
            investing is the key to wealth, that you need to take big risks to win big. But that's not how real wealth
            is built.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span className="text-white font-bold">Real wealth starts with saving.</span> It starts with discipline. It
            starts with saying "no" to the stuff you don't need so you can say "yes" to the life you've always dreamed
            of.
          </p>

          <p>
            CashVault was built on a simple vision: to help everyday people like you build a financially free life. Not
            through get-rich-quick schemes. Not through risky investments. But through consistent, intentional saving.
          </p>
