## What this repo is about

### What CashVault does

* **Safe Lock** – Lock funds for a fixed period (up to 6 months) to reduce impulsive spending.
* **Target Savings** – Save toward a specific goal and unlock funds only when conditions are met.
* **DCA-ready architecture** – Designed to support recurring savings and dollar-cost averaging in future releases.
* **Bitcoin-native vaults** – Secure native BTC using Taproot/Tapscript spending conditions.

### Supported stacks

CashVault uses the right language for each chain:

* **Solidity (EVM)** – Stablecoins and EVM-based assets
* **Clarity (Stacks)** – Bitcoin-adjacent savings via sBTC
* **Tapscript (Bitcoin)** – Native BTC vaults with timelocks and spending policies

### User flow

1. Connect wallet (EVM, Stacks, or Bitcoin)
2. Choose a savings vault or goal
3. Deposit funds manually
4. Withdraw when conditions are satisfied

### Fees

* Simple, transparent protocol fees
* Charged in the **same asset being saved** (BTC, sBTC, USDC, etc.)
* Designed to be predictable and trust-first

CashVault is built for users who want **fewer impulses and stronger financial habits**, not more charts and leverage.
